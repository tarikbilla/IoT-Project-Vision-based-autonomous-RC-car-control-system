# IoT-Project-Vision-based-autonomous-RC-car-control-system
Vision-Based Autonomous RC Car Control System is a project focused on developing a small-scale autonomous vehicle using computer vision and machine learning. The system begins with manual Bluetooth-based control using a Raspberry Pi and camera setup, then transitions to real-time vision processing to detect the car and track path.
